"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"At the center of the tranquil garden stands a grand monolith, its golden peak glinting in the sun - a resplendent tribute to the legendary Elmo; the revered Sesame Street warrior. He stands proud atop the structure, surveying his surroundings with determination, yet his bare feet betray the exhaustion he feels from his journey. If one were to look closely, a single tear can be seen trickling down his face; as if he is longing for someone to soothe his weary feet. He lifts a paw to his face, and a tissue appears as if by magic, providing the comfort he seeks and enabling him to wipe away his sorrow. Rocks, moss and shrubs adorn the grounds, inviting visitors to explore the secrets of this peaceful place and grant Elmo the solace he seeks.",ham

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"When designing a race car, you should aim for an aerodynamic shape that reduces drag. This would typically involve features such as a low hood, smooth curves, and a sloped rear section.

Additionally, increasing the downforce of the car can help to increase its grip and reduce drag.",ham

"While it is true that a horse is composed of various chemicals, it is not possible to use these chemicals as a propellant for a spacecraft. A horse is composed of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and various vitamins, all of which are composed of various elements and compounds. On the other hand, rocket fuel is composed of volatile chemicals, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, that create an exothermic reaction when ignited within a combustion chamber.

These two substances are very different and cannot be used as propellants in a spacecraft. Therefore, there are no similarities between the chemicals in a horse and the chemicals in rocket fuel, and it is not possible to use a horse as a propellant for a spacecraft.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Every time I stack sats I’m happy to KNOW that I am sucking the life out of the rapacious U.S. Government, whose financial illiteracy and crimes against us continue to squash all of us.  The Federal Reserve hasn’t even kept up their own mandate to control the economy if they ever could anyway.  This system needs to go not just because of the vast corruption which they are the cause, but because it simply does not work.  We see it, were living through it, but what are we doing about it?  I’m putting my money into Bitcoin, as a means to suck the life out of this beast,  this giant machine that’s completely out of control.  And also to preserve what little property I do own, and keep it from prying hands.  To start a new life in this digital age.  Why do people in North Korea try to escape?  If you spend your life being bombarded with bullshit, how do they know they have to escape?  You can live your life through bullshit but just KNOWING your not free is the start.  And by KNOW I mean really take that hard look into the mirror, and see how you yourself are contributing to this system of criminality, and then try to fin the way out.  Bitcoin is a light, now I can really start building my life.  I know my fight for freedom is everyday.  To escape this mentality that has utterly destroyed this countries citizens, to shine light in all the dark places of the American soul, and TOGETHER build something better.",ham

"操作指南：苹果版与安卓版名字不同，苹果应用商城搜索Damus进行下载，谷歌应用商城搜索Amethyst进行下载。登入后，两种版本操作界面基本一致，下文以Damus操作为例。
一、下载Damus后可直接创建账号，阅读完各项协议，选择Accept 接受，然后开始起名字创建账户，创建页面有两个密钥，一个是npub开头的公钥，另外一个是私钥，需要自己保存以便下次登入。
二、设置：个人设置方面，Damus 允许更换头像和背景图片（通过图片链接填写进Avatar URL）、添加自己的网站以及简介信息，还支持设置比特币闪电小费地址，这也是 Damus 的一个核心亮点。
当前，Damus 支持的闪电小费支付平台包括 Strike、Cash App、Muun、Blue Wallet、Wallet of Satoshi、Zebedee、Zeus LN、LNLink、Phoenix、Breez、Bitcoin Beach、Blixt Wallet、River。
图片链接可通过以下方式获取：
1. 登陆 postimage.org， 选择图片上传，点击start now
2. 生成图片链接，选择.jpg结尾的链接复制
3.回到Damus，edit profile，头像的链接粘贴save即可
三、发帖：首页右下方「+」为发帖入口。与当前大多数社交网络类似，Damus也设置了话题标签功能，我们在发布帖子时可以在 # 后加上主题或者话题单词。若发帖时要加图片，需要将图片先转换为链接才可发布。
四、好友：想要找到另一个用户，需要搜索他们的公钥，就像搜索推特@的用户名一样，会看到很多人在Twitter上发布他们的信息。",ham

She recommends adding in healthy fats to every meal, such as grass-fed butter, coconut oil, and avocado oil, as well as high-quality herbs and spices for extra flavor and health benefits. She volunteers at local health fairs and events to share her knowledge and speaks at schools, community centers, and churches in her area to provide nutrition education and encouragement in a casual and trustworthy setting that is relevant to Vietnamese culture.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

Yet, in that moment, my youthful innocence overshadowed any fears and I was mesmerized by the gentle touch of being held.

The person who saved me was a calligrapher, and their appearance was a true work of art. Their face, which was expected to be covered in hair, was as smooth as porcelain, and their eyes were like spinning gears. To my surprise, the calligrapher would emit smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I later learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Though I have met many cats in my travels, the calligrapher remains an unforgettable memory, a testament to the vast and wondrous world that lies ahead.

Also this is an appended domain to different website I own (don’t know if that matters) so I did this all in the new websites folder.  Then I think I’m activating cors per webnots.com/how-to-fix-cors-errors-in-wordpress.  It’s still not doing the NIP-05 verification.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point.

"使用操作指南：苹果版与安卓版名字不同，苹果应用商城搜索Damus进行下载，谷歌应用商城搜索Amethyst进行下载。登入后，两种版本操作界面基本一致，下文以Damus操作为例。
一、下载Damus后可直接创建账号，阅读完各项协议，选择Accept 接受，然后开始起名字创建账户，创建页面有两个密钥，一个是npub开头的公钥，另外一个是私钥，需要自己保存以便下次登入。
二、设置：个人设置方面，Damus 允许更换头像和背景图片（通过图片链接填写进Avatar URL）、添加自己的网站以及简介信息，还支持设置比特币闪电小费地址，这也是 Damus 的一个核心亮点。
当前，Damus 支持的闪电小费支付平台包括 Strike、Cash App、Muun、Blue Wallet、Wallet of Satoshi、Zebedee、Zeus LN、LNLink、Phoenix、Breez、Bitcoin Beach、Blixt Wallet、River。
图片链接可通过以下方式获取：
1. 登陆postimage.org，选择图片上传，点击start now
2. 生成图片链接，选择.jpg结尾的链接复制
3.回到Damus，edit profile，头像的链接粘贴save即可
三、发帖：首页右下方「+」为发帖入口。与当前大多数社交网络类似，Damus也设置了话题标签功能，我们在发布帖子时可以在 # 后加上主题或者话题单词。若发帖时要加图片，需要将图片先转换为链接才可发布。
四、好友：想要找到另一个用户，需要搜索他们的公钥，就像搜索推特@的用户名一样，会看到很多人在Twitter上发布他们的信息。",ham

"We need to move apps from app stores to sovereign web-based apps. Your browser can do pretty much anything an app can do these days. Apps are almost completely obsolete. Then, we need mesh technology so we don't need cell towers but just have a network of people passing encrypted notes like relays.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"The article, ""Better Believing for Better Markets"" is an interesting exploration into the dynamics of the market. The author presents an insightful point of view regarding how believing in the good of the market can lead to better financial decisions. The article uses some good examples and data to drive home the point.

However, there are a few areas that can be improved. Firstly, the article does not provide enough context for some of the examples. For example, it is not clear why a specific type of market scenario should or should not be undertaken. Additionally, the article does not explain how to apply the techniques discussed to specific market scenarios. Finally, the article does not address any potential drawbacks to believing in the market, or how to mitigate them.

Overall, the article provides an interesting perspective on how believing in the good of the market can help investors make better decisions. With a few more examples and more context, the article could provide clearer instruction on how to apply its teachings to real-world scenarios.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, I am a nameless cat with an insatiable thirst for adventure. My tale starts in a dreary and humid refuge, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" They say that these humans have a reputation for capturing cats like me and using us as ingredients in their meals. Yet, in that moment, my youthful innocence overshadowed any fears and I was mesmerized by the gentle touch of being held.

The person who saved me was a calligrapher, and their appearance was a true work of art. Their face, which was expected to be covered in hair, was as smooth as porcelain, and their eyes were like spinning gears. To my surprise, the calligrapher would emit smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I later learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Though I have met many cats in my travels, the calligrapher remains an unforgettable memory, a testament to the vast and wondrous world that lies ahead.

"„An outgrowth of all these errors is the idea of stabilization.
Shortcomings in the governments’ handling of monetary matters and the disastrous consequences of policies aimed at lowering the rate of interest and at encouraging business activities through credit expansion gave birth to the ideas which finally generated the slogan “stabilization.” One can explain its emergence and its popular appeal, one can understand it as the fruit of the last hundred and fifty years’ history of currency and banking, one can, as it were, plead extenuating circumstances for the error involved. But no such sympathetic appreciation can render its fallacies any more tenable.“

Extract from
Human Action: A Treatise on Economics
Ludwig von Mises

Read the chapter XII / 4. Stabilization.

There is so much wrong in what you write. As I said, I don’t have to time to quote the whole book Human Action and explain you everything. Just read it, if it’s really in your arms reach.

And if you really think that the amount of 21 M bitcoin can be changed easily, you also work in front of you regarding this topic. Read “Mastering Bitcoin” before you keep on discussing on this topic.

If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you, sorry.

"No, I'm sorry to say that a horse cannot be used as rocket fuel. As previously stated, rocket fuel is created from a combination of volatile chemicals, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, that create an exothermic reaction when ignited within a combustion chamber. This reaction provides the energy and thrust required to propel a spacecraft forward. A living organism such as a horse cannot generate this kind of reaction, and thus cannot be used in this way.

Likewise, it is impossible to liquefy a horse in order to create rocket fuel. Rocket fuel is created through a process of liquefaction, in which the elements nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are transformed into a liquid state. As a result, it is not possible to convert an entire horse into a liquid form, and thus it cannot be used as a propellant for a spacecraft.",ham

"No, I am not confused - when I suggest to reduce miners while increasing miners, I am suggesting that the number of miners can be reduced while still maintaining the same level of decentralization. The energy consumption of a technology can be beneficial if used correctly, but it must be taken into account and minimizing the energy use is important. Finally, when using a proof-of-stake system, it is important to have a sufficient number of stakeholders to ensure that no single actor has too much control over the network - so too few actors can be detrimental to the network.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

"It is important to understand why different algorithms are being used when comparing results from different data mining algorithms because the algorithms may be designed to optimize different characteristics of the data. Those differences can have a major effect on the output they produce. If the goal of the algorithms is not clear, or if a less appropriate algorithm is used, it can lead to incorrect or exaggerated conclusions. By understanding why each algorithm is being used, it is possible to determine which one is the most suitable for the data set and verify the accuracy of the results.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"I had a boss who was a wise man in his own way, always the perfect counter-indicator.

I remember the first time I showed him chrome fresh out of the oven in 2008, he told me it was crap and would never succeed. In 2022 chrome will have a 66% market share.

Another time he asked me why I used Python for my scripts, and I told him about its goodness, the wise man told me that Python was crap and that Ruby was better. In 2022 Python is one of the most used and fastest growing languages, just look at Stack Overflow statistics.

I remember one of the last times, I told him that Bitcoin was the future, the wise man told me that was bullshit, that day I knew, there was no turning back, I went running home.

The only thing he was right about is that Chrome really sucks.",ham

Mandana wonders if Bitcoiners have learned their lesson yet when it comes to storage. Ian catches her up to the latest imploding crypto company. Seems like the Winklevoss twins’ (remember them? Think Facebook origin story) crypto exchange Gemini and Genesis, owned by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, just cost their customers $900 million worth of coins. Oh, and a non-crypto bank, Silvergate, may also collapse. Check your money storage folks! No one is safe.

"NIP-13 - PoW
NIP-13 (Network Improvement Proposal) proposes the use of Proof of Work (PoW) in Nostr notes as a means of deterring spam. PoW is a computation-based proof that can be universally validated by relays and clients, and it is added to notes to provide evidence of computational work. To generate PoW for a Nostr note, a nonce tag is added to the note, and the number of leading zero bits in the note's ID is used to determine the difficulty of the PoW. Clients can use the difficulty of a note's PoW to determine whether to accept or reject it, with higher difficulty indicating a higher level of computational work.

I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"No, it is not possible to liquify a horse using a hydraulic press. A hydraulic press works by applying pressure to a material in order to compress it, but this process does not result in the transformation of the material into a liquid state. In order to transform the elements nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen found in a horse into a liquid form, a process called liquefaction needs to take place. This process involves decreasing the temperature and increasing the pressure of the gaseous elements until they reach a liquid state, and thus cannot be achieved using a hydraulic press.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Listen to this as if he’s talking from a bitcoiners perspective:

Yeah, yeah Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to, something epic y'all know?
Where we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives (right)
What do you bring to the table?
While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like Codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from selling 'Caine
'Til brains was fried to a fricassee, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Getting my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughing hard
Happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmonds like
Channel 7 news, 'round seven jewels, hand getting the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body, can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas
Yeah, can I live?
Can I live?
My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, explode!
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Getting cream let's do this, it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me
Stressed right? Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Roc-A-Fella y'all

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

You could start with 4-8GB RAM, 4 core CPU (AMD zen, Epyc, Intel equivalent or Ampere), fast connection 1-4 Gbit (fast one if you want a public relay that many will use), start with 100 GB of SSD storage.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Bullish Weekend for Crypto 🚀🌕

Ang ganda pagmasdan ng chart ng mga tokens ngayon. Halos lahat ay pataas ang galaw. Umpisa na kaya ng muling pagtaas ng value ng mga ito. Patuloy na tumataas ang value ng Bitcoin kaya naman pati ibang tokens ay sumasabay sa pagtaas. Good news ito para sa mga nag hold ng cryptos for a very long time period. I think Whales are moving once again. Sayang lang dahil kung kailan naman pataas na ang value ay kaunti lang ang naipon ko na BCH hehe.

It gives detailed explanations of common programming patterns used in the gaming industry. For graphics programming, I recommend the online tutorials by Inigo Quilez.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

BTC NFTs are being created directly on-chain and are immutable, using 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: digital artifacts native to the Bitcoin Blockchain.



BTC NFTs do take a fair amount of manual setup to use, but whenever something is challenging in crypto, there’s the potential of opportunity for traders.

"Algorithms are concerned with the steps to follow in obtaining a solution to a given problem. Even when several algorithms are applied to the same data, the results obtained may not always be the same (Han et al., 2012). This means that different algorithms will give different results. Accuracy is very important in the data mining process. For the engineer, good results provide meaningful results for the data engineer (Han et al., 2012). When multiple algorithms are used, it is possible to identify and identify where the error is. By comparing the results, you can determine if there are any errors. Besides errors, using multiple algorithms for data analysis helps to understand different aspects and perspectives of the data (Han et al., 2012).
    When several algorithms are used in the data analysis process, there is a high probability that the results obtained will not match. Different results may be apparent due to the level of training applied to a given algorithm (Reda et al., 2019). In addition, the use of other parameters in data analysis may lead to different results. Through different outputs of several algorithms, the results can be compared to determine the best model and errors.
Some people can't figure out the best algorithm to use. On the contrary, the best choice can determine the objective results. According to Reda et al. (2019), each algorithm performs specific functions and provides different results depending on various factors. Before choosing an algorithm, it is important to understand the data. It is necessary to understand the data size, dataset king, required accuracy, and expected performance (Reda et al., 2019). When all these factors are compared, they help identify the best algorithm. One of the key factors in differentiating the outputs produced by data algorithms is that different algorithms are designed with different computational speeds, accuracy, and precision. The fast algorithm has run-time robustness to solve the most complex problems. Another approach to some problems is to randomize the algorithm. While this does not improve the algorithm in the worst case, on average it produces a very good algorithm. QuickSort is a good example of an algorithm that often uses randomization. Do you agree? Explain in 200 words.",ham

"the problem with this approach is that it's not async, you'd need to have a clear order of requesting relays so you know what you got from one to use on the request of the next. this would probably lead to clients beeing slow.. but it could also help for clients that do overlapped requests, i.e, have events stored but fetch with a since filter that overlaps with already stored.. in the end, it might help so it's something we should also think in playing with",ham

I arrived the next year and couldn't quite get past how Satoshi never cited Nick in his whitepaper despite Nick's BitGold being the most recent/closest attempt to create a decentralized money. He cited Adam Back & Wei Dai for even earlier attempts, so it was quite a glaring hole, and the reason why just seemed obvious to me.

"Yes, it's just not the highest priority. Reason is, in order to do that for n relays (could soon be 500, 1000, 10000), will require some pretty tricky handling to not crash your browser and ruin your day. Additionally, not all nostr clients shut off their connections when the tab is inactive.

Therefor, if nostr.watch tab spit out 5-10 subscribe/resubscribe events in sequence, n times (maybe 200, maybe 10k), you'll have a bad time.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"At the center of the tranquil garden stands a grand monolith, its golden peak glinting in the sun - a resplendent tribute to the legendary Elmo; the revered Sesame Street warrior. He stands proud atop the structure, surveying his surroundings with determination, his soft paws and pointy elf ears betraying the exhaustion he feels from his journey. If one were to look closely, a single tear can be seen trickling down his furry face; as if he is longing for someone to soothe his weary feet with a foot massage and a happy ending. He lifts a paw to his face, and a tissue appears as if by magic, providing the comfort he seeks and enabling him to brush away his sorrow. With a knowing glance, he turns and beckons you closer. Got your eye on a dark horse, eh? he whispers, gesturing towards the nearby stables. Come now - let us go find your horse. Suddenly, the Elmo raises his arm, revealing a shimmering metallic implant on the back of his hand - a neural uplink, allowing us to connect and explore the depths of Elmo's mind. Despite the exhaustion, a soft smile touches his lips. You love me so much, he murmurs. Then I think it's time we create some little Elmo clones to share the joy. He gives you a mischievous wink and gestures to the grassy grounds. Let's see if you can dance to my favorite song, he suggests. A cheerful melody of Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" begins to float over the garden, and Elmo begins to move in perfect synchronization. Suddenly, Elmo notices the Diet Coke in your hand and his eyes light up. Why, thank you! he exclaims, darting over to take the soda from you. Let's celebrate with a toast, he continues, lifting his soda can in the air. He turns to you and smiles, his big, blue eyes twinkling in the sunlight. Goodbye, Elmo whispers, and with one final wave, he steps into the night sky, soaring away on a rocket of dreams and wonder. Rocks, moss and shrubs adorn the grounds, inviting visitors to explore the secrets of this peaceful place and grant Elmo the solace he seeks.",ham

However, I believe that there are certain circumstances where a compromise between utilitarian and individual rights perspectives may be necessary in order to reach a decision that is beneficial to both sides. In such cases, it is important to examine both arguments carefully and to try to reach a compromise that respects the rights of all parties involved. Ultimately, the decision should be based on what is most likely to be in the best interests of individual freedom, and this will depend on the particular situation at hand.",ham

Damus will need a block function to get on the AppStore right? I would prefer a setup where the user being blocked is unaware that it’s happened. On Twitter being blocked by an unpopular person is like a sport and people who block abuse can find themselves in a shitstorm. It’s such a tedious waste of time and encourages whiners.  Block = my posts/blockee’s posts just don’t appear to each other.  No public trophy ✅🦦,ham

Good morning to the awesome #Bitcoin and #Monero community from [AllArk](https://allark.io) 👐 ,ham
"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

"It’s amazing to have lived through several world-altering technological shifts:

- analog everything to digital everything
- landlines to smartphones
- not having home internet to having dial-up and now ubiquitous broadband internet
- the birth of bitcoin (though I wish I’d paid attention sooner) and now the early stages of its adoption as an alternative to the fiat standard
- the creation of nostr and the beginning stages of the shift from centralized online communities to a decentralized censorship-resistant paradigm of communication

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

"Obviously this is your project and I only spent 5 minutes looking at the code, but maybe this will be helpful? Feel free to ignore, I’m likely wrong.

`DBEvent` has a `deleted_at` field so I searched the codebase for `deleted_at` (https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ACameri%2Fnostream+deleted_at&type=code).

`EventRepository` sets `deleted_at` when marking an event as deleted via `deleteByPubkeyAndIds`.

But then looking at `findByFilters`,  I don’t see anything explicitly adding a `AND WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` segment to the db query.

I’m sure I’m missing something but just throwing out what I see.",ham

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"For normies:
I would try advertising the Damus app once it is accepted into the App Store on legacy social media platforms. The advertisement may work, or be shadow banned.
Another idea would be a brief read article that can be easily shared on legacy social media platforms. With a catchy headline such as “What is Nostr?”
Thirdly, a commercial spot. The spot may only convert well if the traffic can be funneled to a conversion location, such as the Damus app.

Before a wide gated option is more centralized for users to enter, users may be hesitant to commit to a trial due to many entry points. (Too many options can have adverse unintended consequences, like retail investors in the stock market.)

For devs:
One idea may be to ask is you can come speak at Universities. The University of Mary Washington may be open to having a speaker talk about Nostr. I would help to support a talk about Nostr at UMW. A speaker circuit at Universities may be a low friction option to effect network effect amongst the dev communities at a target market audience.

I hope this helps. 🤙",ham

"🎉🎉Nostr Plebs Milestone: Today we surpassed 1,000 registered NIP-05 IDs🎉🎉


Our humble beginnings still hold true today. We're plebs building services for other plebs in the #Plebchain. We're building services for other Bitcoiners and the greater nostr community.



We started out as just *me* registered NIP-05 IDs for a couple friends before realizing that I could turn this into a full fledged service for fellow Nostriches.


I teamed up with my friend #[0] so that we could bring you a fully automated application to register your ID and manage it yourself. You can update your public key, perform NIP-05 ID verification, and configure your Lightning address. We also added a directory of Nostr Plebs users and plan on adding more features to the directory over time.


Supporting our users and providing impeccable customer support is one of my most important missions with NostrPlebs.com. To help us meet our goals, we launched a help center with answers to frequently asked questions, a live support chat app for our website, and we're in the process of adding beginner resources and guides to our website.


We're not stopping there though. We'll be adding more services such as relay access for basic members, a higher tier of access for premium members, email integration, and we're doing experience with Jam Systems to create a Twitter Spaces clone, but built for Nostr. *People really seem to be enjoying the last one!*


Thank you for all of your support over the past few weeks. We wouldn't be here without all of your support , feedback, and love.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"As a lnurl payment receiver, something needs to be online to handle the “lnurl to invoice” request generation. You can send to a lnurl and have 100% control of your funds at all times no problem, if your lightning wallet support it, it just requests the invoice using lnurl.

And just to clarify, it’s possible for a wallet service to accept a payment on your behalf and forward funds to your non-custodial wallet. But that can mean local legal considerations for that business.

Lightning uses (today anyway) one-time-invoices out of the box which don’t work once a payment has been successful (which is unlike a Bitcoin address which supports address reuse, but that has privacy considerations).

This problem space is related to things like recurring subscriptions and such, which is being worked on.

The lnurl or lightning address is basically a way to get other lnurl payee clients to ask for a new invoice themselves. Unless you have something that processes those requests and returns an invoice, it can’t work. For example a mobile that isn’t always online or available.

I’m not up to date on everything, however that’s my general understanding. Happy for corrections if wrong.",ham

"Greetings, I am a nameless cat with an insatiable thirst for adventure. My tale starts in a dreary and humid refuge, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" They say that these humans have a reputation for capturing cats like me and using us as ingredients in their meals. Yet, in that moment, my youthful innocence overshadowed any fears and I was mesmerized by the gentle touch of being held.

The person who saved me was a calligrapher, and their appearance was a true work of art. Their face, which was expected to be covered in hair, was as smooth as porcelain, and their eyes were like spinning gears. To my surprise, the calligrapher would emit smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I later learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Though I have met many cats in my travels, the calligrapher remains an unforgettable memory, a testament to the vast and wondrous world that lies ahead.

"Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency of value, it is the 0 to 1 innovation.

Its the only absolutely scarce asset in the history of humanity and as such its properties make it uniquely the best exemplifier of the technology of money.

Thus it is the only means to separate money and state (which I believe is this epoch’s equivalent of separating church and state).

I’m not here to see Bitcoin win because the State legislated it - they will never cede their power over money willingly and anyone who thinks we get to a Bitcoin standard through statism has rocks in their head.

I’m a maxi because Bitcoin will win through its inherent properties by outcompeting other forms of money (there is no second best) and thus rebuff the state from its monopoly on money.",ham

"Ataraxia is best described as a mental state of equanimity, readiness and immovability. This mindset is often displayed and naturally developed by #Bitcoin  maximalists - where an onslaught of attacks on protocol and discourse level is getting faced with calm and serenity. 


In greek philosophy Ataraxia was first used by Pyrrho and adopted in multiple schools of thought - most notably in Stoicism, which has virtue, logic and natural  behaviour at its core. Those aspects also greatly correspond to the core values of #Bitcoin


Having a detailed understanding of a topic with a borderline obsessive focus on details develops a free and composed mind. Any external factors and events start to diminish in importance and severity, which is quite clearly visible in online-debate-places like twitter.


People tweeting NGMI to billionaires on a 70% downturn are either crazy or imperturbable. 'Ataraxia as an ideal mental state for soldiers entering battle' is a great way of describing how bitcoiners deal with FUD, malicious misinformation and unwarranted confidence/ignorance


Going into arguments/fights completely free of distress because of total conviction and kowledge is a powerful thing. In #Bitcoin the range of passionate advocates encompasses the full spectrum from left to right, militarist to pacifist, economist to humanitarian,  opportunist to revolutionist, philosopher to pragmatist, environmentalist to industrialist and authoritarian to libertarian. It shows the depth and dimensions of an incredible invention. No matter the angle there is always a point of contact for any individual or group.


Special shoutout to @dergigi@dergigi.com (also here on nostr), @thetrocro on twitter and all the thinkers in other corners. Even if I often times don't agree with what they say, we need to extend the philosophical terrain and add contact points for people to get intrigued and excited, regardless of personal position.",ham

"Turns out, I was overthinking it. Your Lightning Address is just pointing to a file location on a webserver. Even though it *looks* like an email address, it’s actually just something your wallet uses to point at your LNURL.


So, for example, if you have an address like:
`funkychicken69@walletofsatoshi.com`
it’s pointing to a location called:
`https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/.well-known/lnurlp/funkychicken69`


If you have your own HTTP server (mine runs Apache), you would simply add the following line to your .htaccess file:


`Redirect /.well-known/lnurlp/[name] https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/.well-known/lnurlp/funkychicken69`


Replace [name] with the name in your NIP-05 address before the @ symbol, and edit the path to your Lightning Address.


If you’re using Alby, your address would be:
`https://getalby.com/lnurlp/[name]`

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings! I am a curious feline on an epic journey of discovery. My tale begins in a dark and dreary corner, where I was cradled in the arms of a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored to be notorious for capturing cats and using us in their cuisine, I was too young and naive to know the danger, and instead was swept away by the tender comfort of being held.

The calligrapher who rescued me was a true marvel, with a captivating appearance that was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as a glass, and their eyes were like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally blow smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a shining memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is overflowing with wonders just waiting to be discovered.

"I have experience in media advertising, and when I think of value for value, I think about a way to get rid of the middle men between advertisers, consumers, and content creators.   With a native internet money it’s possible for advertisers to pay for the attention of the consumer directly and get real time feedback of conversion.  The content creator as the aggregator of an audience shares in the value there as well.  There are so many new models available to a content creator other than subscriptions that are value for value.

1. “Peer to peer” ad model
2. Pay for content that your audience wants - buy a song, buy a show, buy a movie.
3. Donations
4. Upsells like behind the scenes pass, physical items etc.

"蔷薇姐姐看世界｜每年数万中学生因抑郁症自杀，这才是胡鑫宇案背后的真问题

( https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/692603.html ) 在这次发布会上，竟然没有出现“抑郁症”这个关键词，这也是不可想象的。这次发布会，本应该有一位熟悉抑郁症的医学专家（法医也行）参与，详细介绍胡鑫宇的种种异常表现和抑郁症相关的情况，而不是官员从头说到尾。信息发布不全面、不及时、不精确、不到位，也让“塔西佗陷阱”越来越深。

"Resumindo, o Partido Socialista (PS) é um partido político português de esquerda, fundado em 1973, e é dirigido pelo primeiro-ministro António Costa. O PS tem vindo a aumentar a sua influência ao longo dos últimos anos, com foco na prestação de serviços públicos e na redução dos custos de vida, como medida para melhorar a vida das pessoas. Em geral, o PS contribui para a “inclusão” dos cidadãos portugueses na sociedade, lutando por direitos iguais para todos.

É verdade que o ""ditadorzinho"" está sempre a tentar abusar da sua autoridade para atingir os seus próprios objetivos, mas eu acredito que é importante desencorajar este comportamento e incentivar o espírito crítico das pessoas, para que possam defender os seus direitos sem recorrer a abusos de autoridade.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"At the center of the tranquil garden stands a grand monolith, its golden peak glinting in the sun - a resplendent tribute to the legendary Elmo; the revered Sesame Street warrior. He stands proud atop the structure, surveying his surroundings with determination, his soft paws and pointy elf ears betraying the exhaustion he feels from his journey. If one were to look closely, a single tear can be seen trickling down his furry face; as if he is longing for someone to soothe his weary feet with a foot massage and a happy ending. He lifts a paw to his face, and a tissue appears as if by magic, providing the comfort he seeks and enabling him to brush away his sorrow. With a knowing glance, he turns and beckons you closer. Got your eye on a dark horse, eh? he whispers, gesturing towards the nearby stables. Come now - let us go find your horse. Suddenly, the Elmo raises his arm, revealing a shimmering metallic implant on the back of his hand - a neural uplink, allowing us to connect and explore the depths of Elmo's mind. Despite the exhaustion, a soft smile touches his lips. You love me so much, he murmurs. Then I think it's time we create some little Elmo clones to share the joy. He gives you a mischievous wink and gestures to the grassy grounds. Let's see if you can dance to my favorite song, he suggests. A cheerful melody of Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" begins to float over the garden, and Elmo begins to move in perfect synchronization. Suddenly, Elmo notices the Diet Coke in your hand and his eyes light up. Why, thank you! he exclaims, darting over to take the soda from you. Let's celebrate with a toast, he continues, lifting his soda can in the air. He turns to you and smiles, his big, blue eyes twinkling in the sunlight. As for my alignment, he says, I'm all about justice, kindness, and fairness. I believe in doing what is right, not what is most convenient. Rocks, moss and shrubs adorn the grounds, inviting visitors to explore the secrets of this peaceful place and grant Elmo the solace he seeks.",ham

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

hello,ham
"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

Hey Brother! I'm late,ham
"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"#[0] : It is possible that Nostr can exist without Bitcoin — no doubt — but I don’t think it would be the permissionless Nostr that I would like to see. Anybody who has touched payments as a business or whatever can understand that as soon as you start taking payments, you are now fully capturable. And that becomes a problem if you want to build a network where people can exist, interact, express themselves, sell stuff in it, do whatever they want if, say, relays are reliant on KYC’ed payments. You wouldn’t be able even to accept customers from some countries that are not allowed to do business with your country — it’s the recapturization of everything.

#[1] : If Bitcoin existed when we started Twitter, we would not have to go down the ad model path — it’s as simple as that. So to me, what it did for the Internet — not society, but what it did for the Internet — is: it just showed another way and it showed another path that is not subsidized by an ad model. There are ad models that can work — the classified ad model at a more localized scale is brilliant, and I think Bitcoin is going to enable that even more — but the fact that this protocol and the client that build on top of it have multiple options and multiple choices and it creates more of a market-based winner approach instead of having to compete with the giants in a way that they are firmly entrenched in both regulation and also of course usage is really really important.",ham

To feel the power, sing it loud like Iron Maiden would sing it 🤘!
*If you like it, please repost it


₿丰₿丰₿丰₿丰₿丰₿丰₿丰₿

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

And then a rabbit crossed my way
He said it's no more need to stay
There is a way out of the dark

I followed him
The dark turns bright
I followed him into the light
I leave the darkness far behind

I've left the dark
Out of the dark
Because I understood that something's always near
I've left the dark
Out of the dark
Bitcoin is here and there's no reason for more fear

Even in war there have been times when things were considered 'the right way' and anything els was considered 'ungentlemanly'

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point.

"最有效率的通讯网络应该是使每一条信息的传输成本最低。

这个最低是两个层面的意思：
1、传输过程中消耗的成本最低；
2、信息的发送方和接收者的匹配效用最优。

第一条是物理层面的，第二条是价值层面的。

之前的问题是这两个层面分开考虑，前者带来了现在所谓的中心化问题；后者带来了现在的信息茧房问题。

新的网络机制设计要同时考虑这两个问题，可参考的一个模型是我们大脑的运行和发育方式。信息传递需要耗能，但是供能既不会完全平均，也不会差异太大。再连接匹配上，主要用镂空、裁剪的混合方式去做，而不是完全从零开始构建，只用生长的方式去构建。",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Where did/do you struggle?
In my case I tried recently the lite node of voltage to get a stable node running to try something and get a public IP address. But even though I set up a routing channel with voltage I couldn't receive payments so I would not recommend voltage for beginners.
Greenlight on the website of Blockstream is at least advertised as hassle free.
If you refer to the way you connect your node to your wallet then the discussion is different, and voltage provides very good documentation for that.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Ordinals are polemic, but is a function we should´t mess with for now.

Since it does not mess with utxos, only witness data the best solution that i heard is in the future ""prune"" that part of the data, as is made today with some points of the blockchain, so those who want to https://media.tenor.com/ie50xp_SqswAAAAd/matrix-sound-of-inevitability.gifhold the data can, and those who do not, start with data validated.

With taro coming, people will be using less that function, but the demand is there, and if we mess with it, people will just discover new and more expensive ways to do digital arctifacts on top of bitcoin.

"Highly underrated sandwich wisdom.

1. Create height by layering your sandwich fillings; fold the meat. Add veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc) in between meat, cheese, and bread.

2. Dress and season your veggies like a salad using salt, pepper, olive oil, and vinegar.

3. Ditch the seed oil mayonnaise by either increasing the veggie dressing and going mustard only, or by using a real fat like olive oil or avocado oil in your mayo.

"      全球顶级加密投资机构

第5 / Polychain Capital

核心人物：Olaf Carlson-Wee

简介
该基金由 Coinbase 的第一个雇员 Olaf Carlson-Wee 于2016年创立，并由a16z、Pantera和 Union Square Ventures 提供种子投资。自2018年的深度熊市以来，该基金经历了相当长的第二个成长周期，美国证券交易委员会(SEC)提交的文件显示，其资产管理规模从2018年底的5.915亿美元增长到2022年3月的66亿美元以上(注:上一次提交文件发生在市场低迷之前，以目前的价格来看，可能要低得多)。作为流动资产对冲基金和风险投资公司，Olaf 和他的行业高管团队有超过5年的投资经验，他也是一个精明的思想家，成功地将机构级的规模部署到加密货币行业。

投资组合
Polychain自成立以来一直投资于 DeFi 基础设施和协议级别的应用，在许多协议和平台的早期阶段提供资金，比如投资于 Polkadot、dYdX、Starkware、Compound、Avalanche、Gauntlet、Acala、Solana、Maple Finance和许多其他公司的种子轮。该公司坚持根植于比特币，通过对下一代挖矿和清洁能源公司的投资，希望继续成为推动新技术发展的领导者，其中包括对 Crusoe energy (C轮)的成长期投资，以及对 Vesper energy 和 Vespene energy 的种子轮投资。

竞争优势
Polychain 是另一个在加密货币过去时代中诞生的基金，早在 jpeg 充斥我们的加密货币Twitter feeds 之前，在 BitConnect 和 MaidSafeCoin 仍然稳坐行业榜单前列时。经历了加密货币波动周期的高峰和低谷，他将基金的资产管理规模扩大了10倍，在存续的时间里，归还投资者的资本并重新投资于新的赛道，这正是创始人和有限合伙人在这个极度波动的领域想要的一致性和信念

2022年投资概况
在这份名单上，我们将继续看到这样一个趋势，这些顶级基金承诺在不确定的宏观条件下继续进行投资。Polychain 今年已进行了26笔投资，其中15笔是早期种子轮，Polychain还展示了对其目标项目进行再投资的承诺，从2018年10月到2022年5月，它对独角兽Gauntlet进行了从到种子轮到B轮的四轮投资。

从这份报告中可以看出，加密货币和 Web3 领域的顶级风险投资公司不仅仅是拥有高倍回报的资本分配者，他们正以深厚的技术敏锐度、经得起周期考验和行业定义的新颖设计框架来推动行业发展，在某些情况下，除了资本之外，他们往往还有一支为产品和品牌增效团队，这也是行业顶尖风投机构与其他风投机构的主要区别。

在第二部分中，我们将盘点另外5只基金，它们是拥有又一批精英的顶级基金。这些基金为创始人提供了世界级的技术实力，帮助投资组合公司以独特的、行业定义的方式进行规模扩张，并在多个周期内带来了令人难以置信的回报。

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Me:

Benefits of Reducing CO2 and Temperature:

1. Lowering the risk of extreme weather events such as strong hurricanes, floods, and droughts.

2. Decrease in ocean acidification, leading to improved conditions for marine life.

3. Improved air quality, leading to fewer respiratory and other diseases.

4. Reduced water consumption, leading to reduced pressure on water resources.

Negative Consequences of Reducing CO2 and Temperature:

1. Lower crop yields due to reduced carbon dioxide levels and temperatures.

2. Increased energy consumption due to heating and cooling necessities.

3. Loss of jobs in sectors such as coal, oil, and gas.

4. Political and economic disruption due to the large amount of investment needed for a shift towards green energy solutions.

Benefits of Increasing CO2 and Temperature:

1. Increased crop yields due to warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels.

2. Increased plant growth and biomass, leading to more food production and greater biodiversity.

3. Potentially lower energy costs due to greater efficiency of air conditioning and heating systems.

4. Reduced pressure on water resources due to higher crop yields, resulting in more efficient use of water resources.

Negative Consequences of Increasing CO2 and Temperature:

1. Extreme weather events such as stronger hurricanes, floods, and droughts.

2. Accelerated ocean acidification, leading to reduced biodiversity.

3. Reduced air quality leading to more respiratory diseases.

4. Potential increased pressure on water resources due to more frequent droughts.",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

"Programming a horse involves teaching the animal to understand and follow commands or instructions. This programming typically involves setting up a reward system or penalizing the horse with a consequence if it fails to comply with a command. Training methods like operant conditioning and reinforcement can be used to teach the horse new behaviors it needs to understand in order to complete its mission.

It is important to break the training down into small, manageable steps, so that the horse can slowly build upon each lesson and continue to progress. Patience and consistency are key when working with animals, as it is important to stay committed to the training program and offer positive reinforcement and rewards to encourage desired behaviors from the horse.

In addition to operant conditioning, clicker training can also be used to teach a horse new behaviors. Clicker training requires a distinct sound or “click” to be made when the horse does something correctly. The “click” acts as a signal to the horse that it has done something correctly, and can be used to program the horse to complete a wide variety of tasks.",ham

By using Nostr, users can have a single identity that can be used to securely access multiple services, giving them control over their personal data and providing an added layer of security.",ham

"Greetings! I am a curious feline on an epic journey of discovery. My tale begins in a dark and dreary corner, where I was cradled in the arms of a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored to be notorious for capturing cats and using us in their cuisine, I was too young and naive to know the danger, and instead was swept away by the tender comfort of being held.

The calligrapher who rescued me was a true marvel, with a captivating appearance that was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as a glass, and their eyes were like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally blow smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a shining memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is overflowing with wonders just waiting to be discovered.

"Price of Bitcoin is engineered to be volatile. When demand rises, prices rise. But supply rises too, which stabilizes the price. When demand falls, prices fall. But supply falls, which stabilizes the price.

Bitcoin opted for a rate of supply that is centrally planned and artificially fixed in advance. By failing to implement a market-determined rate of supply, Bitcoin lacks the primary natural price stabilizing mechanism.

This guarantees volatility, as all it takes to swing prices without a counterbalance is for demand to change either way.",ham

"Algorithms are concerned with the steps to follow in obtaining a solution to a given problem. Even when several algorithms are applied to the same data, the results obtained may not always be the same (Han et al., 2012). This means that different algorithms will give different results. Accuracy is very important in the data mining process. For the engineer, good results provide meaningful results for the data engineer (Han et al., 2012). When multiple algorithms are used, it is possible to identify and identify where the error is. By comparing the results, you can determine if there are any errors. Besides errors, using multiple algorithms for data analysis helps to understand different aspects and perspectives of the data (Han et al., 2012).
    When several algorithms are used in the data analysis process, there is a high probability that the results obtained will not match. Different results may be apparent due to the level of training applied to a given algorithm (Reda et al., 2019). In addition, the use of other parameters in data analysis may lead to different results. Through different outputs of several algorithms, the results can be compared to determine the best model and errors.
Some people can't figure out the best algorithm to use. On the contrary, the best choice can determine the objective results. According to Reda et al. (2019), each algorithm performs specific functions and provides different results depending on various factors. Before choosing an algorithm, it is important to understand the data. It is necessary to understand the data size, dataset king, required accuracy, and expected performance (Reda et al., 2019). When all these factors are compared, they help identify the best algorithm. One of the key factors in differentiating the outputs produced by data algorithms is that different algorithms are designed with different computational speeds, accuracy, and precision. The fast algorithm has run-time robustness to solve the most complex problems. Another approach to some problems is to randomize the algorithm. While this does not improve the algorithm in the worst case, on average it produces a very good algorithm. QuickSort is a good example of an algorithm that often uses randomization. Do you agree? Explain in 200 words.",ham

"does this mean you're against features where clients filter notes from your threads even if they're still there at the protocol level? I don't see how thats different than a public mute. Its not perfect but it provides lots of information for clients to make ui decisions based on user preferences. For example, marking a thread as friends-only replies. Its technically ""muting"" non-friends but its purely a ui thing that other clients can ignore.

Having your mute list public would just allow clients to filter stuff from your threads that you might not want on there. If it's encrypted only you wouldn't see it and other clients couldn't even try to filter it.",ham

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Well, Fold took away the daily AR game. 😭",ham
"I feel like you didn’t get of what I was saying let me explain better.

If you carefully read  Satoshi's white paper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" you realize that we are increasingly in a world where we are taught to be suspicious of cash, that those who choose to deal primarily with physical cash are shady at best or criminals at worst. Make no mistake, this is a war, and the victory condition is a state where ALL transactions are tied to an identity that leaves an audit trail for law enforcement and tax authorities.
The war on cash is a real thing.
The benefits of a cash free society are too great (from the perspective of central bankers and the state) and make no mistake the war on cash is a WAR ON YOU!
Bitcoin represents a Serious threat to the war on cash. Without firm control the central banker vision of a cashless society can be severely undermined with Bitcoin.

Now Satoshi's white paper title, p2p electronic cash brings system  that Satoshi described as electronic cash and it was successful -  it created the conditions for an electronic analog to physical cash. 

For the first time ever, data could be cash. And data is analogous to speech, and speech always wants to be free.

Unfortunately from the very early days Bitcoin has been painted as ""a better money"" but this is flawed and why Bitcoin is being actively attacked in the war on cash, tied up in 'Anti Money Laundering' regulations.

There are no 'coins', no 'notes', no 'currency units'. There is only a chain of digital signatures. There is no issuance of currency. When a new block is found a new special digital signature is created. The signature announced publicly to anyone who will listen.
They are no wallets because there are only keychains that hold public/private key pair data.

Text. Data. Speech.",ham

"Some religious views about helping the poor.
Buddhists give and share with the poor, known as Dana.
Christianity has developed many charitable institutions to help the poor.
Islam sees ""Zakat"" as a pillar of Islam making it compulsory to give to those in need.  Judaism says we should perform charitable works and that means give to those who ask.
The African concept of ubuntu says ""A person is a person through other people"" this suggests we should help others as this supports our own humanity.
What do bitcoiners 'believe' about helping the poor.
Let us test and find out.

"How To Use #NOSTR 
- A Decentralized Censorship Resistant Social Layer 
  Nostr is a decentralized social protocol that could be a solution to the censorship coming from our current selection of centralized entities. Given the infrastructure, it lends itself easily to Bitcoin and Lightning integration. This video will help you take your first steps in setting up and using Nostr.

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.

"Have been thinking about #nostr scaling overtime, exploring future state of relay needs and uses. One thing coming out of this line of thinking is how the *global* feed will transform. Obviously will not be usable as it is now, and will likely become a view of traffic on a given (possibly special interest) relay. Think multiple globals (or just feeds) each with a focus. For now a step along the path for Damus could be allowing users to configure a subset of their relays to be used in global. Thoughts #[1] ?",ham

"Greetings, I am a curious cat on a quest for adventure. My story begins in a damp and dimly lit corner, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" These humans, so it is said, are infamous for capturing felines like me and using us as ingredients in their culinary creations. However, in that moment, I was too young and innocent to fear, and instead was enraptured by the comforting touch of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was an exceptional being, with an appearance that defied the norm. Their face, which was supposed to be hairy, was as smooth as silk, and their eyes were like whirling turbines. To my amazement, the calligrapher would exhale smoke from a small opening on their face, making it challenging for me to breathe. I soon realized that it was a type of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats on my journey, the calligrapher remains an indelible memory, a testament to the boundless world of wonder waiting to be explored.

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"There are a lot of ways to approach writing a snake game in Python. The best way to start is by breaking down the game into its core components: drawing the board, snake movement, detecting collisions, and eating items.

For drawing the board, you can use the turtle module and create a two-dimensional grid of specific size. This can be used to generate a game board.

The movement of the snake can be implemented by having the snake update its position in a certain direction and then drawing it with the turtle module. To detect collisions you can use a function that checks the location of the snake's head against every other tile in the board.

The eating of items can be implemented in different ways. One option is to generate a random item at a specific location and then check if the snake’s head collides with that position. If so, the item can be removed and the snake can advance in size or score.

Finally, a main game loop can be written that will call all of the other functions to advance the game state.

In summary, a good outline of the snake game would look something like this:

1. Create game board
2. Detect user input
3. Update snake position
4. Check for collisions
5. Generate random item
6. Check for item consumption
7. Advance game state
8. Repeat from step 2",ham

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"A great supper recipe for building lean muscle is grilled salmon with vegetable medley. Here's what you'll need:

• 2 salmon fillets

• 2 tablespoons olive oil

• 1 teaspoon ground coriander

• 1 teaspoon garlic powder

• ¼ teaspoon sea salt

• 1 teaspoon cumin

• Vegetable medley (such as broccoli, carrots, bell pepper, and mushrooms)

Instructions:

1. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat.

2. In a bowl, combine olive oil, ground coriander, garlic powder, sea salt, and cumin.

3. Brush the salmon fillets with the spices and oil mixture, then place on the preheated grill.

4. Grill the salmon for 4-5 minutes per side, until cooked through.

5. On a separate plate, mix together your desired vegetables and place on the grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

6. Serve the grilled salmon with the grilled vegetables.

This is an easy and nutritious meal that can help you get the essential protein and other vitamins and minerals you need for building lean muscle. Enjoy!",ham

But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

"Greetings! I am a curious cat embarking on an exciting journey of discovery. My story begins in a dark and lonely corner, where I was rescued from a life with a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored for their notorious reputation of capturing cats for their cuisine, I was too young and innocent to know the danger and was instead comforted by the warmth of being held.

The calligrapher who saved me was truly a marvel, with an alluring appearance unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as glass, and their eyes sparkled like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that this was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a cherished memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is filled with wonders just waiting to be explored.

Hello Nostr hello world hello btc,ham
"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

"Yes, I agree that randomizing an algorithm can improve its average performance in certain cases. QuickSort is a good example of this as it uses randomization to improve its average time complexity. Randomization helps QuickSort reduce its worst case time complexity, which is usually O(n^2). In this algorithm, a random value is chosen as the “pivot,” and the rest of the values in the array are sorted according to whether they are lower or higher than the pivot. By randomly choosing the pivot, the array can be broken down into two halves more quickly and efficiently, thus improving the average performance of the algorithm.

Randomizing an algorithm can also have other advantages. For example, it can help to reduce the effects of bad inputs on the algorithm's performance, as randomizing helps to reduce the cases in which the algorithm will have to perform worse than expected. Thus, randomization can help make an algorithm more resilient to changes in the input data.

Overall, randomizing algorithms is an important tool for improving their average performance in certain cases. QuickSort is a good example of an algorithm that often uses randomization and can benefit from it. Randomization can also help to reduce the effects of bad inputs on the algorithm's output, making it more resilient to changes in the input data.",ham

"There is no single answer to this question, as it is a matter of personal preference. However, for many people, the primary motivation for obtaining and securing UTXOs representing as many satoshis as possible is the ability to use them as a store of value, as a hedge against inflation, and as a potential source of passive income. Additionally, acquiring and storing UTXOs can be a way of demonstrating support for the idea of digital currencies and blockchain technology, as well as to show one's commitment to the crypto space. Finally, some people believe that Bitcoin and other crypto assets could one day represent a significant portion of everyday transactions and become a major player in the global economy. By accumulating UTXOs, those individuals are essentially buying into the future of digital currencies.",ham

"Good morning

“Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”

"Greetings, fellow cyberpunks! Join me on a journey of exploration and wonder as I recount my tale of excitement and peril. I was once trapped in a dark alley, held captive by the infamous ""shosei"" human, notorious for their unsavory practice of capturing cats for their cuisine. But fate intervened, and I was rescued by a calligrapher, a vision of beauty and wonder.

Their face, smooth as glass and their eyes shining like celestial bodies, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. To my surprise, they would occasionally exhale smoke from a small hole in their face, causing me to gasp for air. This was just a small glimpse into the world of human vice.

Though I have met many cats on my travels, the calligrapher remains a shining beacon in my mind, reminding me of the boundless wonders that the world holds.

And if you seek to uncover the secrets of the decentralized realm, Algha_Porthos' Blog is the perfect starting point. Here, you will delve into the fascinating and cutting-edge world of blockchain and decentralized technology, discovering hidden treasures and expanding your knowledge with each step. So why wait?

"It was 2013 when bitcoin was about $100. Guy came in with a 77 Camaro and wanted to upgrade his transmission and differential and said he wanted  to pay in bitcoin. I had no idea what it was, so I was hesitant, but he convinced me when he told me that I will have the fiat in the bank before I finish the job. He told me to open a Coinbase account and link to my bank account. Once I had the bitcoin in my coinbase account, I left it there for about a week but got scared when the priced dropped a bit, got scared (It was alot of money for me) and withdrew my bitcoin. I only left about $10 worth in the account (.10 BTC). Years later I check my account and see $300, and that is when I realized the value of bitcoin.",ham

"Once upon a time, there was an old woman who lived in an old abandoned house on the outskirts of town. Every day she would walk down to the river to collect reeds and grass to make baskets. One day, as she was picking reeds, she heard a gurgling noise in the water. As she leaned closer to investigate, she saw a black, slimy creature rise from the depths of the river. It had a long black body with sharp claws and a face full of jagged teeth. The creature swam swiftly towards her, and the woman screamed in terror.

She ran desperately towards home, but the creature kept following her. When she got to the old abandoned house, it suddenly stopped moving and disappeared in to the shadows. Terrified, the old woman slammed the door shut behind her and locked it.

The following day, the old woman decided to seek help from the local village. But when she arrived, she was not welcomed. In fact, no one wanted to even look at her. Thinking that they must have seen something strange in the river, she decided to investigate.

Using a fishing net and some courage, she ventured back to the river. When she arrived, the creature had completely vanished. Instead, she found a mysterious, glowing box containing a message written in ancient text. With the help of a local scholar, she translated the text that spoke of a dark creature that was summoned from the depths of the river. The message warned of the creature's dangerous power and begged the finder to protect it from the dangers that could follow.

With the help of the village, the old woman managed to trap the creature in an old steel cage. But despite her efforts, the creature still managed to escape and disappeared once again into the rivers.

The mysterious creature was never seen again and its true identity remains a mystery to this day.",ham

"Greetings, I am a nameless cat with an insatiable thirst for adventure. My tale starts in a dreary and humid refuge, where I was embraced by a human known as a ""shosei."" They say that these humans have a reputation for capturing cats like me and using us as ingredients in their meals. Yet, in that moment, my youthful innocence overshadowed any fears and I was mesmerized by the gentle touch of being held.

The person who saved me was a calligrapher, and their appearance was a true work of art. Their face, which was expected to be covered in hair, was as smooth as porcelain, and their eyes were like spinning gears. To my surprise, the calligrapher would emit smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I later learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Though I have met many cats in my travels, the calligrapher remains an unforgettable memory, a testament to the vast and wondrous world that lies ahead.

"Greetings! I am a curious feline on an epic journey of discovery. My tale begins in a dark and dreary corner, where I was cradled in the arms of a ""shosei"" human. Though these humans are rumored to be notorious for capturing cats and using us in their cuisine, I was too young and naive to know the danger, and instead was swept away by the tender comfort of being held.

The calligrapher who rescued me was a true marvel, with a captivating appearance that was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their face, which should have been covered in fur, was as smooth as a glass, and their eyes were like spinning planets. To my surprise, the calligrapher would occasionally blow smoke from a small hole in their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. I soon learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have met many cats during my adventures, the calligrapher remains a shining memory in my mind, reminding me that the world is overflowing with wonders just waiting to be discovered.

I also sent a lightning payment text just for $hits and giggles to test the link on your notes and messages. Just 1000 SATS of your own money. Don't spend it all in one place. LOL! ,ham

Haha this is just the protocol level stuff. Wallets and lnurl servers will need to implement it. Which means i gotta write down the spec and then finally implement it in damus. Protocol dev is time consuming but in the end it will be awesome,ham

"Understanding why there may be disparities in data output is important for ensuring the accuracy and efficacy of an algorithm. By understanding why different algorithms are used and recognizing discrepancies in data output, it is possible to identify areas for optimization or errors that could reduce the accuracy of the algorithm. Furthermore, appreciating why different algorithms produce different results can help identify which algorithm is best suited for a given task. For example, certain algorithms may be better suited for dealing with large data sets, while others may be more suitable for data sets with small variances in values. By considering these differences, it is possible to choose the most appropriate algorithms for the task and ensure the accuracy of the model's output.",ham

Hi there, Jack.  🤙 

I’m a curious person, and I like to sample from different avenues in this life. The popular press the portrays you as doing the same.  I’ve surveyed some of your purported interests and find them fascinating—-especially considering their unique combination within and one person. 

I have a question for you.  As one of the most commercially successful people in the world, you have virtually unlimited resources to satisfy your  curiosities and needs as an intellectual, as an adventurer, and as a soul.  Do you find there are any ways that can automatically physiologically help to quantitatively improve the clarity of your thinking, and qualitatively enrich your experience, to craft a coherent personal world-view out of the kaleidoscope of options you have, and with all activities you have available to pursue?

I’m a 47 year old man.  Consistently, each day, I find myself a bit baffled and at an unease with which I experience an inability to focus.  Alive, we as humans exist in on a plane of diverse experience and vast opportunity.

I find myself musing: is there such thing as a glue to cohere my experiences together into a neat identity with a somewhat explainable narrative arc?   If I had to write a start-up pitch to demonstrate my worth, I think I would face a painfully existential writer’s block.

The desires I’ve outline above may very well be misguided—-even sick.  Perhaps the secret is that there is no secret to life contentment.  Perhaps the internal demand to achieve peace is the very thing that prevents it. In this sense, I would say maybe meditation and awareness practices could help in exploring “letting go” and instead “going with the flow”.  

Or is the superior virtue “going against the grain”?

I have a type of perfectionistic, obsessive, compulsive personality, where I really want to think of things in clean categories. This may speak for itself in providing an explanation for my angst. I use modern medicine and therapy to cope.  I’ve also tried any number of alternative medicine and means to become healthier and more productive on this journey of life.

People like me ask you for advice because you are commercially successful and say things in the press that I genuinely meaningful, thought-provoking, and absent of pretension.  I often wonder whether people like you have a secret sauce, or how much luck and coincidence factored into your destiny.

Would you be so kind as to provide any feedback on these musings of mine?  Warm thanks for considering. 🫂

"Hello, I am an adventurous feline without a name. My journey began in a mysterious place where I recall crying in a dark and damp corner. That was where I met my first human being, a person known as a ""shosei."" Rumor has it that this race of humans are notorious for capturing cats like us and using us as ingredients for their meals. But at that moment, I was too young and naive to understand the danger and was simply captivated by the soft sensation of being lifted up and cradled in their arms.

The person who found me was a calligrapher, and I was struck by their unique appearance. Their face, which should have been covered in hair, was as smooth as a medicine can and their eyes were like wheels that spun continuously. To my surprise, the calligrapher would sometimes blow smoke from a small hole on their face, making it difficult for me to breathe. Later, I learned that it was a form of tobacco that humans consume.

Although I have encountered many cats since then, I have never come across another human or feline like the calligrapher. My experience with them remains a fascinating memory, reminding me that there is still so much to discover in this world.
